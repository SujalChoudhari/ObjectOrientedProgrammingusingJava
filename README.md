# Java
*Write Once, ~~Run Anywhere~~ Debug Everywhere!*

Java is a high-level, general-purpose programming language that is designed to be simple, portable, and platform-independent. It was first released by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle Corporation) in 1995 and has since become one of the most widely used programming languages in the world. It is widely used for developing applications that run on various platforms, such as Windows, Linux, Mac OS, and Android. Java is designed to be portable, secure, robust, and efficient. Some of the features of Java are:

- It follows the principle of "write once, run anywhere", meaning that the same code can run on different machines without recompilation.
- It supports multiple inheritance through interfaces and abstract classes.
- It has a rich set of libraries that provide functionality for networking, database access, graphics, user interface, and more.
- It supports concurrency and multithreading through synchronized methods and blocks.
- It has a built-in garbage collector that automatically manages memory allocation and deallocation.
